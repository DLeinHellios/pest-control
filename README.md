# Pest Control - Battle for the Lawn
![Title](screenshots/title.png?raw=true)

## Description
Pest Control is a simple arena control game, where the player who can populate the battlefield with the most units is crowned the victor. The ants and spiders are locked in the age-old dispute - What is the optimal number of legs? In this insect vs. arthropod battle for the ages, the only means of victory is to outnumber your opponent. Move, copy, convert, and overtake the lawn.

## Gameplay
Only two players are supported over local (hotseat) multiplayer. Players take turns acting with their available units. Turn is indicated by the arrow on the bottom of the screen. Use the mouse to select your unit; you are then able to select an adjacent space to copy that unit, or a space further to move that unit from its original position. Once a unit is placed next to opposing units, it will convert those units in the surrounding square. The game continues until one player is no longer able to make any valid moves, and the player with the most units is declared the winner.
